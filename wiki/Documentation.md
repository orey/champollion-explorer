<H3>Purpose of the Calendar Explorer</H3>
<P>I personally have hundreds of files on my computers, being at work or personal, files that I intend to put in the appropriate folders. But it occurs that sometimes, files are not located where they are supposed to be. I know we have the standard search windows included inside Linux or Windows, but those searches are not often totally successful.</P>
<P>Frequently, my only way of finding back a file on my hard drive is to find it by date. I remember having manipulated that file at a particular date, or in a certain range of dates.</P>
<P>Calendar Explorer is done for this kind of work. One single page HTML contains the links to all your user files being in various folders on your hard drive (also on different drives for Win32 users which is quite convenient), all that classified by date and time from the most recent to the oldest.</P>
<P>For me, it was a real help in my current daily working life, where I store huge amounts of files on my laptop.
<LI>In one HTML page searchable page, I was able to find files per name, whatever there physical location was.</LI>
<LI> Moreover, with the menu on the left frame, I was able to quickly browse by date and find the files I was searching.</LI>
<LI>By clicking on the 'folder' link, I was able to navigate directly inside my hard drive from a specific file location.</LI></P>
<P>Very small but quite a useful tool...</P>
<P>OK, you can say to me that a few things are too simple in the version 0.1 :
<LI>Calendar Explorer is only based on the "last modification date". That's a fact, and it can be a problem when I did modify a file without really realizing it. I can have some troubles finding it back because it has not the date I can suppose he has... Yes, troubling :-)</LI>
<LI> You can say also : what ? 5 Java classes on Source Forge for a very basic old school HTML without any CSS ? I will say yes again, because I did not have time to add goodies. But see you in the next release...</P>
<H3>Installation</H3>
<H4>Java runtime</H4>
<P>This application is a Java application. You first need to install JRE 6.0 or more recent on your workstation/laptop. In order to check if you got the appropriate version already installed, you can type on a terminal window :<BR>
<PRE>&gt; java -version<BR>
java version "1.6.0_07"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_07-b06)
Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 10.0-b23, mixed mode)
&gt;</PRE></P>
<H4>Download the CalendarExplorer-0.1.zip file</H4>
<P>Unzip this file on a specific folder and change the parameters of one of the .properties files (either Linux or Win32). Input the folders you want to examine and provide the output file name in the .properties file.</P>
<P>Use one of the launch file to run the program (either .sh or .bat). Under Linux, ensure that the file is executable by you (else use 'chmod' command).</P>
<H3>Use</H3>
<P>The best way to use the Calendar Explorer is to create two shortcuts :
<LI>The first one in Win32 quick launch targeting the .bat file, or under Linux, one shortcut in the menu bar targeting the .sh file ; this shortcut will be used for regeneration of the HTML file. This will be the first click.</LI>
<LI>The second one is to bookmark the HTML file on your favorite internet browser. As it is a local file which name is not changing with regeneration you will be able to have always a fresh view of your working folders in the browser. This will be the second click. By the way, do not forget to refresh after regenerating the file (most browsers are caching).</LI></P>
<P>Note that clicking a link will make the browser propose you to download or open the file (chose open) or will open the file, directly embedding it inside the browser (for instance for PDF if you have special browser settings).</P>
<P>That is all, enjoy. And do not hesitate to feedback on <A href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge.net</A></P>
